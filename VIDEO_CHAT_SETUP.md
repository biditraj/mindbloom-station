# Video Chat Setup Instructions

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Demo video chat is working (tests camera/microphone)
- ✅ All code components are implemented and ready
- ⏳ Database migration needed for full functionality

## To Enable Full Video Chat:

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to your project: `ghhjczfhjeybfdrynpjf`
3. Go to SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-video-chat.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute the script

### Step 2: Switch to Full Video Chat
Once the database is set up, edit `src/pages/Chat.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change this line:
import DemoVideoChat from '@/components/DemoVideoChat';

// To this:
import VideoChat from '@/components/VideoChat';

// And change the component:
<DemoVideoChat /> → <VideoChat />
```

## What Works Now 🎉

### Demo Mode (Current):
- ✅ Camera and microphone testing
- ✅ Video/audio toggle controls
- ✅ Permission handling and error messages
- ✅ Responsive UI with guidelines

### Full Mode (After DB Setup):
- 🎯 Random user matching via queue system
- 🎥 Real-time peer-to-peer video chat
- 🔄 Skip to next user functionality
- 🚨 Report system for inappropriate behavior
- 📊 Session tracking and analytics
- 🔒 Complete anonymity and privacy

## Technical Details

### Database Tables Created:
- `matchmaking_queue` - User pairing system
- `video_chat_sessions` - Active session tracking
- `signaling_messages` - WebRTC communication
- `session_reports` - Safety reporting
- `connection_logs` - Debugging and analytics

### Security Features:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Anonymous user identification
- Permission-based access control
- Automatic cleanup of old data

### WebRTC Implementation:
- Simple-Peer for P2P connections
- Supabase Realtime for signaling
- Media permission handling
- Connection retry mechanisms

## Testing the Demo 🧪

1. Navigate to the Chat page
2. Click "Test Camera & Microphone"
3. Allow permissions when prompted
4. Test video/audio controls
5. Verify everything works before database setup

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Camera/Microphone Issues:
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure no other apps are using the devices
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if HTTPS is enabled (required for WebRTC)

### After Database Setup:
- Clear browser cache/cookies
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all tables were created in Supabase
- Test with two different browser windows/devices

## Production Considerations 🚀

### Required for Production:
- HTTPS certificate (WebRTC requirement)
- STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal
- Content moderation system
- User reporting and admin dashboard
- Performance monitoring

### Optional Enhancements:
- Video quality selection
- Screen sharing capability
- Text chat overlay
- User preferences and matching criteria
- Mobile app compatibility

## Support 💬

If you encounter issues:
